## About X Framework

Ever wanted to use Laravel without the expensive footprint. X Framework is a heavily inspired framework based upon the concepts of Laravel, CodeIgniter and Django. X Framework is designed to build elegant apps faster. It takes the pain out of development by easing common tasks used in many web projects, such as:

- Routing
- Dependency Injection
- File System
- Database, Query Builder, Models
- Eventing
- Front-End Integrated
- Command Line Interface

## Learning X Framework

Although X Framework is small compared to its competitors, X Framework has a very extensive API. The [documentation](http://samlovescoding.com/x) is the best place to get started.
